This folder contains the files data used for the logistic regression model to test wether the predicted immunogenicity against certain epitopes is associated with longevity.

# Files

- `DRB1.csv` and `DRB1_1.csv` are the immunogenicity scores predicted by TLimmuno2 for every individual.

- `GSAdata_raw.merge.HapMapIII_CGRCh37.eigenval` and `GSAdata_raw.merge.HapMapIII_CGRCh37.eigenvec` are the princpal components form QC processing the Immunochip data.

- `Selection of epitopes.xlsx` is the file to correlate the epitope sequence with the protein name. It is the selection of epitopes used as imput for TLimmuno2. The two `DRB1*.csv` files should contain the epitopes described in this file.
