A selection of epitopes were manually obtained from the IEDB database. The dataset was downloaded in Excel format with a single header row. The query parameters were:

- Epitope Structure: Linear Sequence
- Peptide Minimum Length: 13
- Peptide Maximum Length: 25
- Organism: Homo sapiens (human) (ID:9606, human)
- Include Positive Assays
- MHC Restriction Type: HLA-DRB1 protein complex (ID:MRO_0001278, HLA-DRB1)
- Host: Homo sapiens (human)
- Disease Data: Autoimmune Disease
- Export Type: Full, all data columns

Date Exported: July 24, 2025

The epitopes were then converted to fasta and uploaded to NetMHCIIpan for binding affinity predictions. The results were stored in the folder of next step.
